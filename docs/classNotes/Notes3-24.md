# Notes From 3/24 #

## Stuff to know for the test ##
- abs error vs realtive error,
- machine eps,


## unit testing structure, ##
- turning loggin on and off
- fprintf()
- check arguments
- assert(!=null qsolve(params))
- log addresses of qslove()
- use mock object sometimes sqrt
- test will use relative error or absolute error

## unit testing ##
- mock object
- expect
- return 

## Wednesday ##
---------------
- set up appts for feasibility report review

## Things to do to project ##
--------------------------------
* Version Control
  * Subdirectory structure
      * Readme in every directory 
      * Makefile and maketest
      * Documentation
        * Feasibility Report
        * Programming Standards
        * TPS Reports
        * Unit Test standards
        * Documentation for all libraries and modules used in project
        * Legal
  * Src 
    * Subdirectories for all modules
  * spikes
               
## Test on version control and unit testing soonish? ##
----------------------------------------------------
* Know what IEEE types are, absolute error, finite precision, NaN's, Floating Points.  
  * Will be on a test or something
* machine epsilon 

## QUAD project ##
-----------------------------
1. Use mock objects for the square root function ONLY the square root function is required to have unit testing

2. In addition to the unit testing the project needs
  * logging:           name of routine, correctly output all args, needs to be turned on and off
  * check args:        check the three inputs, type check them
  * Must give relative error, the error in the rounding.
3. Use doxoygen
